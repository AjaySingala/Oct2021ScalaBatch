Kafka / Streaming:

Streaming:
----------
It means listening to music, watching movies etc. in "real time", intead of downloading a file to your Pc and then watching it later.
"Buffering".

Event Streaming (ES):
----------------
Not referring to "events" like concerts, Apple event, Microsoft Ignite event etc.
Event Streaming is The practice of capturing data in real-time from event sources like databases, mobile devices, sensors, cloud services, applications etc.
	The data comes in the form of a "stream of events".
		IoT : Internet of Things.
	Store these event streams durably somewhere (in a DB, queue, file etc.) for later retrieval.
	Can be manipulated, processed further.
	Apps can react to the events streams in real-time as well as retrospectively (later).
	Route the event streams to different destinations as needed.
ES ensures a continuous flow of data and also a continuous interpretation of the data
	so that the right information is at the right place at the right time.
	
Uses of ES:
	To process financial / payment transactions in real-time, like stock exchanges, banks, insurance.
	To track and monitor vehicles (cabs, trucks, cars, fleets, shipments) in real-time, like logistics, self-drive cars etc.
	To continuously capture and analyze sensor data from IoT devices or any such equipments, for e.g.; in factories, power generation units etc.
	To collect and immediately react to customer interactions / orders, for e.g.; retail, hotel & travel industry etc.
	To monitor patients in health care industry, even predict changes in condition to ensure timely treatment in case of emergencies.
	
How does Kafka fit into this?
KAFKA: Is an event streaming platform.
	Write (publish) and read (subscribe) to streams of events, including continuous import/export of data from other systems.
	Store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.
	Process the stream of events as they occur or retrospectively (later).
	
	All of this functionality is provided in a distributed, highly scalable, fault-tolerant, elastic and secure manner.
	Can be deployed on bare-metal hardware VMs, containers, on-premise, on-cloud.
	There are options of fully-managed Kafka service by different vendors.
	
An event records the fact that something happened somewhere (in the world, business, web site etc.).
It is called a "message".
An application / device / event source will send a "message" to the event streaming platform - Kafka.
Example of a event:
	has a key
	has a value
	has a timestamp
	may have optional metadata (headers).
	
	Event key: "Ajay"
	Event value: "Made a payment of $1500 to John"
	Event timestamp: "Nov 15, 2021 at 2:00 pm"
	
Producers: Are client applications that write (publish) events to Kafka.
Consumers: Are client applicaitons that read (subscribe to) and process these events.
In Kafka, these Producers and Consumers are fully decoupled and agnostic of each other.
Consumer can read the event, process it and then either:
	save it to a DB
	save it to a file
	send it to another Kafka storage
	send it to an API
	display on the console

These Events (messages) that come in to Kafka, are stored (organized and durably stored) in "TOPICS".
A topic is similar to a file-folder on a filesystem.
Events are files that are stored in this folder.
There can be multiple producers and consumers for a Topic.
A producer may publish to multiple topics.
A consumer may subscribe to multiple topics.
A topic may not have any subscriber or producer.

Events in a topic can be read as many times and as often as needed.
This is unlike some traditional messaging systems where once a message is read, it is deleted after consumption.
	For e.g.; A QUEUE!
	
Types of Messaging Systems:
Point-to-Point:
	Producer sends message into the queue.
	Each message is read by only one consumer.
	Once the message is consumed, it vanishes from the queue.
	Mutliple consumers reading messages from the queue.
		But 2 (or more) consumers cannot read the same message.
Publish-Subscribe:
	Message producers are called Publishers.
	Message consumers are called Subscribers.
	
	Publisher sends messages into 1 or more topics.
	Subscribers can receive messages from 1 or more topics and consume them.
	
Topics are partitioned, meaning a topic is spread across multiple "buckets" located on different "kafka brokers" on the cluster.
Distributed brokers bring scalaiblity, fault-tolerance to Kafka.
Allows clients to read/write from/.to multiple brokers at the same time.
When a new event is published to a topic, it is actually appended to one of topic's partitions.
Events with the same event key (for e.g.; vehicle ID) are written to the same partition.
Kafka guarantees that any consumer (subscriber) of a given topic-partition will always read the events in the same order as they were written.

Kafka APIs:
	Admin API: manage, inspect, configure Topics, brokers, other Kafka objects.
	Producer API: to publish (write) a stream of events to one or more topics.
	Consumer API: to subscribe (read) sttream of events from one or more topics and process them.
	Kafka Streams API: to implement stream processing applications with microservices.
						operations like aggregations, joins etc.
	Kafka Connect API: to build and run reusable data import/export connectors that read / write streams of events from/to external systems / applications.
	
Apache Kafka is aon open-source distributed event streaming platform.
Originally developed at LinkedIn.
The main goal was to create a unified platform that is distributed, scalable for handling real-time data streams.

Core Capabilities:
High throughput: deliver messages at a very fast rate even over low latency.
Scalable: Scale production clusters to up to a 1k brokers, trillions of messages per day, petabytes of data, hundreds/thousands of partitions.
Permanent Storage: Store streams of data safely in a distributed manner, on a fault-tolerant cluster.
High Availabity: Connect spearate clusters across geographic regions.

Ecosystem:
Built-in streaming capabilities: process streams with joins, aggregations, filters, transformations etc.
Connect to almost anything: Out-of-the-box connectors for practically anything, integrates with hundreds/thousands of event sources, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, ElasticSearch, AWS S3 etc.
Client libraries: read, write and process event streams in various programming languages.
Large ecosystem of open source tools: community driven.

Design goals of Kafka:
Scalability
High volume
Low latency
Data transformations
fault tolerance
reliability - distributed, paritioned, replicated, fault-tolerant
durability - remains on disk even after processed (as long as you need)
Performance

Kafka Architecture:
KAfka topics are divided into partitions.
These topics are replicated across machines (using brokers0.
Consumers can read from a topic in parallel.
Each of these brokers has paritions, that are "leaders" and "replicas".
	This gives Kafka good amount of fault-tolerance.
	When the system is working fine, all reads / writes to a topic go thru the leader.
	The leader makes sure that all the other brokers are updated properly.
	If a broker fails, the system can automatically reconfigure itself so that a replica can take over as the new leader for that topic.
	
Role of Zookeeper (ZK):
used to automatically select a leader for a partition.
In case a broker shuts down, the ZK runs an election (kind of), to select the leader position of partitions.
Also has the metadata, like in which broker does the leader reside.
Default port for ZK is 2181.
Default port for Kafka server is 9092. (On the Hortonworks VM, it is 6667)

Role of the Broker:
It is an instance of Kafka that communicates with ZK.
Each broker hold partition(s) of topics.
Some of those paritions on the broker are leaders and others are replicas of the leader partitions from other brokers.

Add path to kafka bin folder in environment variable:
$vi .bashrc
	export $KAFKA_HOME="usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker"
	SAVE+QUIT
$ source .bashrc
$ echo $KAFKA_HOME

Start Kafka and ZK:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/zookeeper.properties
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-server-start.sh $KAFKA_HOME/config/server.properties

List all topics:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
Create a topic:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic sampleTopic
Describe a topic:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic sampleTopic

Topic:sampleTopic       PartitionCount:1        ReplicationFactor:3     Configs:
        Topic: sampleTopic      Partition: 0    Leader: 1    Replicas: 1,2,0  Isr: 1,2,0
		
ISR ==> In-Sync Replica

Leader:1 = broker 1 is responsible for all reads / writes for the given parition.
Replicas: 1,2,0 = broker instances 0,1 and 2 are acting as nodes that replicate the log, irrespective of one being a leader.
Isr: 1,2,0 = broker instances 1,2,0 are in-sync replicas.
ParitionCount:1 and ReplicationFactor:3 = there is 1 partition and 3 replicas of that partition.

Create a console producer:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:6667 --topic sampleTopic

Create a console consumer:
Open a new terminal and then run this...
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:6667 --topic sampleTopic --from-beginning

Using Connectors:
Using Output Sink: file sink:
In terminal 1:
$ cd $KAFKA_HOME/config
$ cp connect-standalone.properties ~
$ cp connect-file-sink.properties ~
$ cp connect-file-source.properties ~

$ cd ~
$ cat > inputfile.txt
Hello there!
Welcome to Kafka.
Testing this file for File Sink and Source Connector
^C
$ cat inputfile.txt
Then,
•	In ~/connect-standalone.properties, change the bootstrap-server property value to sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:6667
•	In ~/connect-file-sink.properties, change the file property value to /home/maria_dev/testlog.out.txt
•	In ~/connect-file-source.properties, change the file property value to /home/maria_dev/inputfile.txt
•	In ~/connect-file-sink.properties and ~/connect-file-source.properties, change the topics property value to the name of a topic you created and want to use for this demo.

$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server sandbox-hdp.hortonworks.com:6667 --topic connectTest1
In terminal 2:
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/connect-standalone.sh ~/connect-standalone.properties ~/connect-file-source.properties ~/connect-file-sink.properties

In Terminal 3:
- Check the contents of the file testlog.out.txt
	$ cat testlog.out.txt
- Add one-or-two lines to the source file as:
$ cat >> inputfile.txt
This line added manually.
Check if it works.
^C
- The new lines should appear in Terminal 1 on the console consumer and in the testlog.out.txt file as well.

Producer and Consumer using Scala:
---------------------------------
How to write messages to Kafka Topic (producer) and read messages from a Kafka Topic (consumer) using Scala.
Producer sends messages to Kafka topics in the form of records.
	A record is a key-value pair.
Consumer receives messages from a topic.

1. Create a topic: text_topic.
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic text_topic
$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

2. Add dependencies in build.sbt
lazy val root = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "kafkaspark",
    libraryDependencies += scalaTest % Test
    ,libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % "1.2.0"
    ,libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "2.1.0"
    // For kafka.
    ,libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql-kafka-0-10" % "2.3.4"
    ,libraryDependencies += "org.apache.kafka" %% "kafka" % "2.1.0"
  )

3. Producer Scala code:
spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.3.4 ./producer.jar --class example.KafkaProducerApp

4. Consumer Scala code:
spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.3.4 ./consumer.jar --class example.KafkaConsumerSubscribeApp


Spark Streaming (SS):
----------------
Spark Streaming is an extension of the Core Spark API, which enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data steams.
Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, TCP sockets, files, DBs etc., which can be processed (map, reduce, join etc.).
Once processed, the data can be pushed to filesystems (HDFS, S3 etc.), Kafka topics, DBs, console, sent to an API etc.
Can also apply ML or Graph processing algorithms on the data streams.
SS receives live input data streams and divides the data into batches, which are then processed by the spark Engine (SE) to generate the final stream of resuls in batches.
SS provides a high-level abstraction called DStream (Discretized Stream), which basically represents a continuous stream of data.
DStream can be created either from input data streams from sources like Kafka, S3, HDFS etc. or by applying operations on other DStreams.
Internally, a DStream is represented as a sequence of RDDs.

Points to remember:
- Once a contexts has been started, no new streaming computation can be added to it.
- once a contexts has been stopped, it cdannot be restarted.
- Only one StreamingContext can be active in a JVM at the same time.
- stop() on StreamingContext, it also stops the SparkContext. To stop only the StreamingContext, set the optional parameter of stop() called stopSparkContext to false. stop(stopSparkContext = false)
- A SparkContext can be reused to create multiple StreamingContexts, as long as the previous StreamingContext is stopped (without stopping the SparkContext) before the next StreamingContext is created.


Spark Structureed Streaming:
----------------------------
Fully supports SparkSQL!!!
AFter processing the streaming data, Spark needs to store it somewhere. Spark uses some "output modes" to store the streaming data.
Output modes are:
	Append mode: Spark will output ony newly processed rows since the last trigger.
	Update mode: Spark will output only updated rows since the last trigger. If we are not using aggregation on streaming data, then it will behave like append mode.
	Complete mode: Spark will output all the rows it has processed so far.
	
Input sources:
Rate (for testing): automatically generates data including 2 columns (timestamp and value).
Socket (for testing): This data source listens to the specified socket and ingest any data into SparkStreaming.
File: This source will listen to a particular directory as streaming data. Supports formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet etc.
Kafka: This source will read data from a Kafka Topic.
