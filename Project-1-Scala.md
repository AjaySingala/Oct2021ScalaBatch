## Project 1
- Project 1 will be a Scala console application that is retrieving data using Hive or MapReduce. Your job is to build a real-time news analyzer. This application should allow users to view the trending topics (e.g. all trending topics for news related to "politics", "tv shows", "movies", "video games", or "sports" only [choose one topic for project]).
- You must present a project proposal to trainer and be approved before proceeding with project.

### MVP:
- ALL user interaction must come purely from the console application
- Hive/MapReduce must:
    - scrap data from datasets from an API based on your topic of choice
- Your console application must:
    - query data to answer at least 6 analysis questions
    - have a login system for all users with passwords
        - 2 types of users: BASIC and ADMIN
        - Users should also be able to update username and password

### Stretch Goals:
- Passwords must be encrypted
- Export all results into a JSON file

### Presentations
- You will be asked to run an analysis using the console application on the day of the presentation, so be prepared to do so.
- We'll have 5-10 minutes a piece, so make sure your presentation can be covered in that time, focusing on the parts of your analysis you find most interesting.

### Technologies
